## 🔐 Authentication & User Roles

The platform supports three distinct user roles:

1. **Students** - Can register for competitions and access learning materials
2. **Coaches** - Can mentor students and manage teams
3. **Administrators** - Have full platform access and management capabilities

Authentication is handled through Firebase Authentication with role-based access control implemented via Firestore security rules.
